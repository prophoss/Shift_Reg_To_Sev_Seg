# Shift_Reg_To_Sev_Seg
This is a project that is for my CIS247C class. My professor allowed me a bit of leeway on our class project. 
He wanted me learn about bit manipulation which includes bitwise operators and left and right shifts. 
I told my mentor about my project and he gave me a challenge of using a shift register to ligt up a seven-segment display.
I was able to get it going but had some difficulty figuring out what pin does what.

Project list:
  Texas Instruments 74HC595 8 bit shift register
  single Seven Segment diplay
  Arduino Mega 256
  8 -330Ohm resitors
  
  
  Right now the code is in Arduino code, but I want to get that translated to C/C++. It is a class requirment.
